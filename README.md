</p>

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Git

### Local Setup

The vercelification of the app made the previous version, which supported self-hosting, irrelevant. But if you can hang with vercel-cli, you can still get it to run locally. 

Or, in other words: the live game runs on Vercel with serverless functions. For full local testing with API functions, use `npx vercel dev`.

- Serverless Functions for the API
